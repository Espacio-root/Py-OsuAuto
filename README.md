Py Osu!Auto
===================

**DISCLAIMER:** This bot is made for educational purposes only. I do not recommend using it on your account, log off before doing so.  

__This bot only works and ALWAYS WILL only work with RELAX MOD toggled on, to discourage cheaters.__


# What is "Osu!"? <h1>
Better than me explaining is you checking it with your own eyes. See it [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home).

But if you want the quick answer:
Osu! is a rhythm game where your objective is to click circles, sliders, and spinners to the beat of the song at the most precise timing possible.
The "beatmaps" are what players... You know... Play? They are made by the community itself so the replayability is infinite!

If the game only had circles and spinners, creating this bot would be the easiest thing ever, but since sliders are a thing my life was ruined while
doing it.
Sliders involve some pretty complicated calculations to find their paths and duration (Bezier curves, circumferences, etc)

# Requirements <h1>
* Python 3
* keyboard module

I made it on Windows but I'm pretty sure it works on Linux too, please let me know about it if you are a Linux user.

# Limitations <h1>
As you can see on the "Issues" tab, this bot is not perfect.

1. It is not FULLY automated. (What do you mean isn't it a BOT?!?) Yes, it'll play almost any map perfectly, but you still need to load the .osu file and start it MANUALLY, read the "How to use" section for more information.
2. This bot does not do Aspire maps. Ye... Sorry about that one
3. Too fast sliders glitch the bot. And by "Too fast" I mean REALLY DAMN FAST. Other than those It works fine.
